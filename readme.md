# makeSea SEA¬≤
## Making a Single-Executable App in Node.JS+ 20

[Single-Executable App](https://nodejs.org/api/all.html#all_single-executable-applications_single-executable-applications) is a new experimental and evolving feature from Node.JS 19. The steps to make one changed in v20 - extra steps to create a JSON descriptor so as to generate an intermediate BLOB.

This repo is a self-contained SEA to ease creation of SEA, just by supplying the bootstrap (JS) file. Hiding all the cumbersome steps.

Last tested OK with my [Node.JS 23.80.0+](https://github.com/sdneon/node/releases/tag/v23.8.0%2B).

### Going Ahead
Another limitation of SEA is that it can only have **One** *embedded script* to run! Hence, for more complex projects, bundling and minifying codes is the way to overcome this limitation, along with self-extracting dependencies/resources.
See companion tools, ***webpack and npm SEA¬≤***s at [this repo](https://github.com/sdneon/webpack-sea).

PS: `makeSea.js` itself is a nice example illustrating how to write a ***self-extracting and single-executable app***, SEA¬≤! Feel free to use it as a template üòÅ

## Usage

1. **Setup**. Download and put makeSea.exe in a working folder.
   * *Optionals* to put in the folder too:
      * Put a copy of of node.exe (an updated version you wish to use) for embedding.
      * Install npm & postject node modules.

    (You can skip the optionals above if you're fine with using makeSea's bundled versions - which may be outdated. makeSea will simply use any already there, or unpack and use its bundled versions).
2. **Prep**. Prepare your bootstrap file for embedding as SEA start point.
3. **Make**. Make the SEA:
```
node makeSea <bootstrap_file_path>
OR
node makeSea [-i asset1_path -i asset2_path ...] <bootstrap_file_path> [optional_output_path]
```
### Example
Use the provided sample/hello.js:
```
node makeSea hello
```
To include assets, use `-i` for each of them:

   ```
   node makeSea -i path/file1.txt -i path/bundle.zip hello
   ```

   * They will be available as their base filename.
   * Recommendation:  if you have lots of assets, bundle them in a ZIP archive. Use a ZIP library like [adm-zip](https://github.com/cthackers/adm-zip) to extract them for use in the SEApp. 

Get asset example:
```js
const sea = require('node:sea');
const assetTxt = sea.getAsset('file1.txt', 'utf8'), //returned as string
    assetBin = sea.getAsset('bundle.zip'); //returned as ArrayBuffer

//extract ZIP'd asset
const AdmZip = require('adm-zip');
const zip = new AdmZip(Buffer.from(assetBin)); //need to convert ArrayBuffer to Node.JS' Buffer
zip.extractAllTo(__dirname); //unzip all
```
   * Unzipping the bundle is useful for delivering a local installation.
   * Alternatively, read individual entries as needed when not all files within are always needed.

See `makeSea.js` itself for details.

### ‚ú®Magic ‚ú®.
Under the hood, several intermediate files are generated as needed by Node:
* SEApp config.json - specifies where bootstrap and optional assets are, and output to what blob name.
* Blob - the thing to be embedded for v20. Previously in v19, the bootstrap JS is embedded directly instead. From v20, blobs are supposed to make embedding other things easier.
* SEA EXE - a copy of node.exe is made as your SEApp.

#### Last Step: npx

The last step to generate the SEApp itself typically uses `npx.cmd`, like so:
```
npx postject ${exePath} NODE_SEA_BLOB ${blobPath} --overwrite --sentinel-fuse NODE_SEA_FUSE_fce680ab2cc467b6e072b8b5df1996b2
```
However, it seems that npx may need an internet connection and will fail otherwise.
Thus, this the following is the alternative that works well.
```
node node_modules/npm/bin/npx-cli.js postject ${exePath} NODE_SEA_BLOB ${blobPath} --overwrite --sentinel-fuse NODE_SEA_FUSE_fce680ab2cc467b6e072b8b5df1996b2
```
